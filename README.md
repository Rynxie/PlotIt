# PlotIt!

PlotIt, is a plotting tool that plots the serial data from USB or ACM using matplotlib and GTK3

It doesn't have to read only USB or ACM you can mod it there is only a few lines to change for it

this program logs the data into a .csv file on a same working directory

It only tested on Arch Linux it can be ported for other linux distros that can run GTK3 and other OS like windows easily since it uses python

the program is too small and literally controls anything so any pull requests welcomed. I made this program because I needed something like this and didn't find a good one .

## To Do

* The Welcome window  inputs validity should be cheked
* Maybe add other OS support?
* And it needs a lot of comments (I didn't add them because I need it done as soon as it can
